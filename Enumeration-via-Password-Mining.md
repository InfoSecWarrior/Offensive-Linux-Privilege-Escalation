# Linux Privilege Escalation: Password Mining

## **Introduction**
Password mining is a crucial technique in Linux privilege escalation where attackers extract sensitive credentials from various system locations to gain elevated access. This document covers different methods of password mining along with relevant commands and exploitation techniques.

## **1. Extracting Browser Stored Passwords**

Web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Chromium, Opera, and others store saved passwords securely in encrypted formats. Below is a detailed breakdown of where these passwords are stored, how they are protected, and methods for accessing them during penetration testing.

## **1.1 Google Chrome**

### Password Location:

 -  Windows ` : C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Login Data `
 -  Linux:  ` ~/.config/google-chrome/Default/Login Data `
 -  MacOS:  ` ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Login Data `

### Storage Format:

 -  Stored in an SQLite database file (Login Data) under the logins table.
 -  Encrypted using the OS’s API:
       - Windows: DPAPI (Data Protection API).
       - Linux: GNOME Keyring or KWallet.
       - MacOS: Keychain.

### Extraction & Decryption:

 Extract Passwords using SQLite:

```bash 
sqlite3 "Login Data" "SELECT origin_url, username_value, password_value FROM logins;" 
```

 -  Decrypt Passwords:
       - Windows: Tools like NirSoft ChromePass or Mimikatz.
       - Linux: GNOME Keyring using secret-tool.
       - MacOS: Use the security command to retrieve Keychain passwords.

## **1.2 Mozilla Firefox**

### Password Location:

 - Windows: ` C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\<profile_name>\logins.json `
 - Linux: ` ~/.mozilla/firefox/<profile_name>/logins.json `
 - MacOS: ` ~/Library/Application/Support/Firefox/Profiles/<profile_name>/logins.json `

### Storage Format:

 -  Passwords are stored in logins.json (encrypted).
 -  Master password protection uses Mozilla’s NSS (Network Security Services) encryption.

### 	Extraction & Decryption:

 - Decrypt the key4.db file, which stores encryption keys.
 - Use tools like Firefox [firefox_decrypt.py](https://github.com/unode/firefox_decrypt) 
   ```
   firefox_decrypt.py -d ~/.mozilla/firefox/<profile_name>
   ``` 

## **1.3 Chromium (Open-Source Chrome)**

### Password Location:

 -  Linux: ` ~/.config/chromium/Default/Login Data `

### 	Storage & Decryption:

 -  Stored in the SQLite Login Data file.
 -  Follows the same decryption methods as Google Chrome.

## **1.4 Opera**

### Password Location:

- Windows: ` C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Roaming\Opera Software\Opera Stable\Login Data `
- Linux: ` ~/.config/opera/Default/Login Data `
- MacOS: ` ~/Library/Application Support/com.operasoftware.Opera/Login Data `

### Storage & Decryption:

 - Opera uses the same structure as Google Chrome since it’s Chromium-based.
 - Decrypt using tools or scripts designed for Chromium.

## **1.5 Microsoft Edge (Chromium-Based)**

### Password Location:

 - Windows: ` C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\Default\Login Data `
 - Linux: ` ~/.config/microsoft-edge/Default/Login Data `
 - MacOS: ` ~/Library/Application Support/Microsoft Edge/Default/Login Data `

### 	Storage & Decryption:

 - Same process as Google Chrome.

## **1.6 Are Passwords Stored as Hashes?**

 - No, browsers typically do not store passwords as hashes. Instead:
 - Passwords are encrypted using OS-based APIs like DPAPI, GNOME Keyring, or Keychain.
 - Hashes are unsuitable because browsers need the plaintext password to auto-fill login forms.

## **1.7 Cracking Browser Passwords**

### Decryption Tools:

 - Browser-Specific Tools:
     - NirSoft Tools (e.g., ChromePass, WebBrowserPassView): For decrypting Chrome, Firefox, and Edge passwords on Windows.
     - Firefox Decrypt: Specifically for Firefox passwords.

### Manual Decryption:

 - Extract SQLite data.
 - Decrypt using Python scripts that interact with DPAPI, Keyring, or Keychain.

### Example Python Script for Windows (DPAPI):

```bash	
import win32crypt
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect("Login Data")
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT origin_url, username_value, password_value FROM logins")

for row in cursor.fetchall():
   url = row[0]
   username = row[1]
   encrypted_password = row[2]
   decrypted_password = win32crypt.CryptUnprotectData(encrypted_password, None, None, None, 0)[1]
   print(f"URL: {url}, Username: {username}, Password: {decrypted_password.decode()}")  
```

## **1.8 Automating Password Mining**

 - For automation, tools like LaZagne can be used:
 - GitHub Link: [LaZagne](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne)
        - LaZagne extracts saved credentials from multiple applications, including browsers.            
 - For more browsers , Applications and additional password extraction techniques, you can refer to LaZagne .

## 4.Backup File Enumeration & Analysis

### 4.1 Identifying Backup File Formats

Before searching for backup files, it’s important to recognize the common formats in which backups are stored:

- `.zip` → ZIP archive
- `.tar `→ Tarball archive
- `.7z `→ 7-Zip compressed file
- `.rar `→ RAR compressed file
- `.bz2` → Bzip2 compressed file
- `.gz `→ Gzip compressed file
- `.tbz `→ Tarball compressed with Bzip2
- `.tgz` → Tarball compressed with Gzip

### 4.2 Finding Backup Files in the System

To search for backup files across the system, use the following command:

```bash
find / -type f \( -iname "*.zip" -o -iname "*.tar" -o -iname "*.7z" -o -iname "*.rar" -o -iname "*.bz2" -o -iname "*.gz" -o -iname "*.tbz" -o -iname "*.tgz" \)
```
#### Explanation:

- `find / `→ Searches from the root directory (/)
- `-type f `→ Looks for files only (ignoring directories)
- `-iname` → Performs a case-insensitive search
- `*.zip, *.tar, *.7z, etc.` → Matches various backup file extensions

### 4.3 Saving the List of Backup Files

To save the output of the above command for further analysis:
```bash
find / -type f \( -iname "*.zip" -o -iname "*.tar" -o -iname "*.7z" -o -iname "*.rar" -o -iname "*.bz2" -o -iname "*.gz" -o -iname "*.tbz" -o -iname "*.tgz" \) > backupfiles.txt
```
#### Explanation:

- This command redirects the list of found backup files to a file named `backupfiles.txt`
- You can later review or `filter this file as needed`

### 4.4 Filtering Unwanted Backup Files

In some cases, system-related backup files may not be relevant. To remove such files from the list:

```bash
 cat backupfiles.txt | grep -vE '(backup/armour|usr/share/|usr/lib)' 
```

#### Explanation:

- `cat backupfiles.txt` → Reads the list of backup files
- `grep -vE` '(backup/armour|usr/share/|usr/lib)' →
           -v → Excludes the matching lines
           -E → Enables extended regex
           The regex pattern (backup/armour|usr/share/|usr/lib) filters out unwanted system directories

To filter out only specific system directories (usr/share/ and usr/lib/), use:

```bash 
cat backupfiles.txt | grep -vE '(usr/share/|usr/lib)'
 ```

#### Explanation:

- Excludes backup files stored in common system directories
- Helps in focusing on potentially sensitive backup files

## 5. Password Mining in Memory

Password mining in memory refers to the process of extracting sensitive information, such as passwords, from the system's memory. This technique is often used in security testing or by attackers to recover credentials from running processes, applications, or the operating system's memory. Since many programs store user passwords temporarily in memory for authentication, they can be retrieved using various tools and methods.

### Accessing System Memory for Password Extraction

#### Using /dev/mem and /dev/kmem

On Linux systems, /dev/mem and /dev/kmem provide access to system memory and kernel memory, respectively. If an attacker has sufficient privileges, they can scan these memory areas for sensitive data, including passwords.

#### Example Command:

```bash
 strings /dev/mem | grep -i PASS
 ```

This command scans the system memory (/dev/mem) for occurrences of the keyword "PASS," potentially revealing stored credentials.

## Conclusion

- Browsers encrypt passwords using OS-level APIs.
- Configuration files often contain sensitive information.
- Tools like LaZagne, Mimikatz, Firefox Decrypt, and NirSoft tools help in extracting stored passwords.
- Environment variables (.env, config.php, etc.) should be secured properly to prevent credential leaks.
